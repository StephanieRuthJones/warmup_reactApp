# Simple React App

### Today you will be creating a React App using only the documentation as a resource. Your app should have:
- One class component at the app level 
- A separate component that contains a Bootstrap Card called by App 
- A button component called by App

### Stretch: 
- Add a constructor and state to App
- State should contain a key called toggle with the value of false
- Write a method to handle the button click that toggles the value of this.state.toggle from true to false
- When this.state.toggle === true, the Bootstrap card should be visible, when it is false, it should not.
